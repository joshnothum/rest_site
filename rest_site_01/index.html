                This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail
                them later. Ow, my spirit! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're
                at it? Can we have Bender Burgers again? Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't
                you just get me the death penalty? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals,
                and then we'll go home. Why not indeed! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything
                you ever believed in. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Why did you bring us here? Tell her you just want to
                talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Fry,
                you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Ask her how her day was. Oh God, what have
                I done? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Why am I sticky and naked?
                Did I miss something fun? Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. So I really am
                important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars.
                Explain that.
